# CSCE-412-Project-5

CSCE 412 is a class in Cloud Computing. In Project 4, we were tasked with buying a domain through NameCheap and pointing it to a secure, static site we built using AWS. I did this using a combination of S3, CloudFront, Route 53, and the Certificate Manager.

In Project 5, we had to automate the site. The requirement was to host the code on GitHub, connect it to the S3 bucket, and automatically have it update the website we created in Project 4. I did this with a combination of S3, Code Pipeline, and Lambda.

You won't see much here at all, as all the automation occurs in AWS.
