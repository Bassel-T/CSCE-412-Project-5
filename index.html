    <h1>CSCE 412 - Mitri Toubbeh Site</h1>
    <p>Greetings, traveler! If you're seeing this, that means you've caught me in the middle of my semester.
        <br>
        This is my fourth project for CSCE 412, where we create a static site using AWS S3 and NameCheap.

    <p>This is the second attempt for CI/CD on AWS Pipeline.</p>
    <br/>
    <p> I think I figured it out, finally. Take two. Does this work?</p>
    <br />
    <p> That worked! And one more for good measure.</p>
